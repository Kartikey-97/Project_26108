kartikey/analysis/test_scope_check.py

Tests for the deterministic scope/material check.

The gap this closes: a tender specifying "1.1 kV grade XLPE insulated armoured
power cables ... conforming to IS 1554 : Part 1" cites a standard that covers
*PVC* insulation. Nothing in the pipeline could see it. The year checks pass
(there is no year), the status checks pass (IS 1554 is active), the QCO check
passes, and the AI verdict for a resolved citation is JUSTIFIED. The defect is
not about the edition; it is about what the standard covers.

Two properties matter more than any single case here, and most of the file is
about them:

  1. It must not fire on a correct citation. A false mismatch tells a
     procurement officer to change a clause that was right, which is worse than
     silence because the report looks like it checked. So the tests below cover
     the near-misses — a material the catalogue has never heard of, a standard
     whose title states no material, a standard whose scope prose mentions the
     material even though its title leads with another.

  2. It must never claim to have checked something it did not. `checked=False`
     and `mismatch=False` mean completely different things, and a report that
     conflates them turns "we could not assess this" into "this is fine".

The vocabulary is not typed in. It is mined from the titles in whatever
catalogue is loaded, so these tests build small stores and assert against what
those stores imply — remove the XLPE standard and the module correctly stops
believing XLPE is a material, which is the behaviour asserted in
`TestVocabularyComesFromTheCatalogue`.
