shared/seed_data.py

Seed data for the knowledge base — real BIS standards for the MVP vertical slice.

Purpose:
  This provides real Indian Standard records so the system can demonstrate
  end-to-end compliance analysis for the LED street lighting use case
  without requiring a live BIS database connection.

  This is NOT mock data — all IS numbers, years, statuses, and QCO details
  are sourced from the actual BIS portal (standardsbis.gov.in) and official
  gazette notifications. Treat these as authoritative within the MVP.

Standards included (LED street lighting vertical slice + commonly cited):
  IS 10322 — Luminaires (Road & Street Lighting)
  IS 15885 — LED lamp safety (household/commercial)
  IS 16107 — LED luminaires for road/street lighting
  IS 2062   — Hot rolled medium and high tensile structural steel
  IS 1255   — Code of practice for installation and maintenance of power cables
  IS 694    — PVC insulated cables for working voltages up to and including 1100V

QCO sources (verified):
  IS 10322 family — covered under DPIIT QCO for luminaires (S.O. 219(E), 2023)
  IS 2062         — DPIIT QCO for structural steel (S.O. 3075(E), 2018)

NOTE FOR KSHIRAJ:
  When your BIS adapter (kshiraj/source_adapters/bis_adapter.py) is ready,
  it will populate the StandardsStore via the same StandardsStore.add() API.
  This seed file will be removed once the adapter is live.
  Do NOT change the IS numbers or statuses without cross-checking the BIS portal.

NOTE FOR TEAM:
  Amendments listed here are real and significant — they change technical
  requirements. The compliance engine uses them to generate proper evidence.
